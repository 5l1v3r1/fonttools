		<h1>RoboFab's Unified Font Objects Overview</h1> 
		
		<p>
			The most detailed information about RoboFab objects is available in <strong>robofabDocs</strong> in the RoboFab distribution. This overview here focusses on a couple of the more important objects and offers examples on how to use them. 
		</p>
		

				<h3>Model</h3>
		<p>Here is a <a href="objects/model.html">handy map</a> of the RoboFab objects.</p><br/>

		<h2>Scope</h2> 
		
		
		<h3>Naming conventions in RoboFab</h3>
		<p>
		Attributes and method names follow a couple of consistent rules which make it easier to remember what they're called.
<ul>
<li>Class names start with a capital: <strong>R</strong>Glyph, <strong>B</strong>asePen etc.</li>
<li>method and attribute names start with lowercase: glyph.<strong>c</strong>enter(), glyph.<strong>w</strong>idth</li>
<li>private attributes and methods start with underscore. point.<strong>_</strong>index. Note: private methods and attributes are needed to make the objects work, but they're not intended for users to mess with, that's why they're called private. The description of the objects in this manual then do not list them.</li>
<li>all names follow camel<strong>C</strong>ase<strong>N</strong>aming as much as possible. So glyph name becomes glyph<strong>N</strong>ame</li>
</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Availability of methods, attributes</h3>
		<p>
			Unless noted otherwise, the examples, methods and attributes should work in all implementations of RoboFab, so within FontLab as well as NoneLab. These reference pages are written by an experienced RoboFab user, not a robot. All the objects have more attributes and methods than listed here. But these are the most important ones to get started with. For a full list refer to the robofabDocs in the RoboFab distribution. 
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Perhaps not documented yet</h3>
		<p>
		As noted earlier, this documentation is written by a person, not a machine. So it is possible attributes, objects, methods are missing. Drop us a line if you're missing something.
