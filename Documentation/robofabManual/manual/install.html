		<h2>
			Which Python?
		</h2>
		<p>
			RoboFab works with any Python 2.2.1 and up. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Which Python for FontLab?
		</h3>
		<p>
			If you're using RoboFab in conjunction with FontLab, there are some restrictions imposed by FontLab's taste in Python. On MacOS the Python version that will work with both FontLab and RoboFab is MacPython-OS9 2.3. FontLab on Windows requires Python 2.2.1 and other OS's: Python 2.3. RoboFab is backwards compatible to Python 2.2.1, but not 2.2. RoboFab now includes a Python 2.2 compatible version of sets.py.
		</p>
			<p class="note">
			Please refer to FontLab documentation for up to date and version specific info on which Python is needed for which FontLab. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			About install.py
		</h3>
		<p>
			In the package, on the same level as this read me there's a install.py script. Running this script creates a file named 
			<strong>
				robofab.pth
			</strong>
			in site-packages. This robofab.pth file contains the path to the current location of the RoboFab package. It does not copy the RoboFab package to site-packages itself, you need to keep the RoboFab package. Also: if you _move_ the RoboFab folder to some other location (or rename any of the directories the RoboFab folder is nested in), you have to run the install.py script again to update the path.

		<h3>
			Dependencies
		</h3>
		<p>
			Some parts of RoboFab depend on other Python modules and packages. These need to be installed as well. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>
					FontTools: 
				</strong>
				Robofab requires Just van Rossum's FontTools package (not to be confused with Apple Inc's set of tools for fonts with the same name). It is recommended that you use the RoboFab installer with FontTools built in, available at 
				<a href="download/license.html">
					the download section</a>. If you must pick up FontTools separately, download the latest snapshot at 
				<a href="http://fonttools.sourceforge.net/cvs-snapshots/gzip/fonttools-current-snapshot.tgz">
					fonttools.sf.net
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The Numeric Python module</strong>, available from sourceforge 
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy">
					here</a>. Note that downloading and installing a project from sourceforge might seem a bit dauting. Unfortunately there is no room here to maintain an install instruction for Numeric as well - please refer to the documentation provided at the project site. NoneLab use of RoboFab and reading and writing of UFO's requires Numeric. Using the RoboFab objects in FontLab can probably work without it. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			RoboFab bundled with FontLab Studio 5
		</h2>
		<p>
			FontLab Studio 5 comes with RoboFab preinstalled. At the time of the 1.1.1 release (September 2005) we don't know just yet how the bundling will work exactly, where the files will be located, how to update etc. We assume that the next release will have more info on that. RoboFab 1.1.1 was released specifically with fixes for this bundle. We tested with FontLab Studio 5 Beta on Windows.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Installing RoboFab on MacPython on Mac OSX, and most Unix.
		</h2>
		<p>
			Python on MacOS is going through an interesting and important transition. It means however that there are several different Python solutions available on different versions of MacOS. Have a look at the 
			<a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/">
				MacPython pages
			</a>
			to familiarize yourself with the options. Apart from that, installing RoboFab consists of running the install.py script in a Python of your choice. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Installing on Mac OSX MacPython &quot;OS9&quot; 2.3, for FontLab.
		</h3>
		<p>
			FontLab 4.6 on Mac OSX has to work with MacPython &quot;OS9&quot; 2.3 (available from 
			<a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/macpython-older.html">
				MacPython</a>). Currently FontLab does not work with the Framework version of Python. In Application/MacPython-OS9 2.3 find the 
			<strong>
				PythonInterpreter</strong>. Then go to the directory where you downloaded RoboFab. Drag install.py on top of PythonInterpreter to run it. If it says 'RoboFab is installed' you're done. Since FontLab uses this version of Python, this procedure also installs RoboFab for use inside FontLab. 
		</p>
		<p>
			RoboFab has two folders of demo scripts and utilities which can be used in FontLab. Copy the contents of the 
			<strong>
				Scripts
			</strong>
			folder to the FontLab/Macros folder to make them available to FontLab. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Permissions
		</h3>
		<p>
			Make sure you have admin permissions on the machine when you install the various packages. When installing as a normal priviliged user, it can sometimes happen that certain files can't be written, and the installation remains incomplete. The most common problem is that one or two preference files need to be written, but the current user does not have enough permissions to delete them. Read the traceback, locate the file, delete, install again.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Installing on Windows
		</h2>
		<p>
			Installing RoboFab on windows should be pretty straightforward. RoboFab is backwards compatible to Python 2.2.1, but not 2.2. RoboFab now includes a Python 2.2 compatible version of sets.py. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Note
		</h3>
		<p>
			FontLab 4.54 (and higher) offer some basic file dialogs which RoboFab 1.1.1 uses. If you want to use file dialogs on Windows in an older (pre- 4.54) version of FontLab, or you want to use file dialogs on Windows, outside of FontLab (NoneLab), then you need to install the free win32 module, which might have dependencies of its own. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The win32 module</strong>, available for download 
				<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html">
					here</a>. This module is needed for some simple dialogs and messages. We might actually move to another module for these services in the future. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Tested in Windows XP Home Edition. If there are special requests or procedures we've forgotten to mention, please let us know. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Installing on other platforms
		</h2>
		<p>
			Place the robofab directory in a place where you can leave it for a while. Not on the desktop or a temporary download folder. Run install.py in a Python interpreter. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Initial testing
		</h2>
		<p>
			Open a Python interactive interpreter window. 
		</p>
<pre>import robofab
# notice, all lowercase!
</pre> 
		<p>
			If you don't get an traceback, you're good to go. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In Scripts/RoboFabIntro/ there are some test scripts, simple examples and some utilities. Read the source to learn more about what the examples do and where they want to run. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Detailed unittesting
		</h2>
		<p>
			Robofab has unittesting to make sure all parts function properly. If you don't know what unittesting is, don't sweat it. If you're interested, go to 
			<strong>
				robofab/test/runAll.py</strong>.
